  <h3>Why Thailand?</h3>
  <p>
    Decided around late September, we decided to spend our 2 week holiday break in
    Thailand (major shout out to how awesome our job is to have a break without
    even making us take vacation days off). Initially we were both considering
    going to Vietnam during this time. However, due to $1800+ in round-trip
    tickets and visa requirements, we decided to plan our trip to be around
    Bangkok and the southern part of Thailand (Phuket & Krabi).

  <h3>Pre-Trip</h3>
  <p>
    To be quite frank, planning for this trip was kept to a minimum. Although we
    had certain places in mind, we definitely didn't book much in terms of hotels
    or activities. We just figured it would be easier (and maybe cheaper) to do it
    once we got there. However, this definitely wasn't the case for trying to get
    private rooms. At any rate, the highlight of this "pre-trip" planning was
    definitely getting our backpacks. Getting a full-fledged "backpacker's"
    backpack was definitely fun and we ultimately chose to get 44L matching
    backpacks by Kelty. The turned out to be super useful for the trip!

  <h3>And So It Began (sort of)...</h3>
  <p>
    The Thailand trip actually started with a much smaller trip to NYC since our
    flight would be going through JFK. We called up an Uber to get to the Eastern
    bus terminal in Chinatown. That morning we came to the sad realization that we
    forgot Emily's GoPro at home (tragic). At any rate, we were soon on our way to
    NYC. We slept through most of this ride and got into Manhattan Chinatown a
    little after noon. As is tradition, we devoured our way through cheap food
    (namely Vanessa's Dumplings and Shu Jiao Fu Zhou). No pictures here, but rest
    assured it was delicious. After walking around New York for a few more hours
    to kill time, Emily and I went to pick up some Meet Fresh (grass jelly
    dessert) and fried chicken for a meet-up with some of Emily's friends.

    The meet-up was essentially a fried chicken tasting consisting of chicken from
    Olive chicken, Jollibee, Blue Ribbon, and Boka with some Meet Fresh for
    dessert. All-in-all, it was a fun time, but just the beginning to our journey.
    After the meet-up, we took a one hour train ride to JFK, spent about an hour
    or so going through the airport, and took off to Abu Dhabi a little before 11
    (our original departure time was supposed to be 10). I wish I could've taken
    some pictures of the airplane food this time, but Emily and I were just way
    too tired to remember. When we landed in Abu Dhabi, our layover was pretty
    unremarkable. About three hours walking around terminals, washing up, and
    resting. Our transfer flight went smoothly and before we knew it, we were in
    Thailand.
